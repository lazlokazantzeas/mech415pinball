sounds 1-4 are meant to cycle when the ball hits a circle on the stage

sounds 5-6 are meant to trigger when the flippers are used

10-13 are for when the ball collides with the flipper

sound 15 for when we launch the ball with the spacebar



i think it would make sense to work on the audio as a class, and keep the main function as clean as possible* 

what i have up is half baked, half tested

no worries if you don't want to work on it
